# DWBI_bank_customer_segmentation

This repository contains a Python script that reads data from `bank_transactions.csv`, located in the `data` folder. We cleaned the data, applied a Box-Cox transformation to improve normality, and standardized the values before analyzing the data using K-means clustering.
